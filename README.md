# capstone-selfie-photographer-of-the-year

## Overview

What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

Selfie Photographer of the Year is a application that hosts a photography contest called Selfie photographer of the Year. Users can upload photos under their profile into several categories. The categories could be "Self Portrait, Underwater Selfie, AI Selfie, and Phone Selfie" The photos will be judged by professions and prizes will be given.

### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

Photography contests are very popular and some get worldwide recognition. The genre of "Photographer of the Year", POTY, hosts some of the most popular, including, Wildlife POTYoty, Landscape POTY, Nature POTY, Underwater POTY, Bird POTY, Close Up POTY, etc... The novel idea of Selfie POTY is my own and could be a very popular genre type that includes not only professional photographers but anyone with a camera "phone". The pain points could include scaling, finding users, finding sponsors for prizes, overall exposure and of course building a platform that will host all the images.

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.

Users will be anyone who enjoys photography. They could be novices or professionals. There must be a profile for each user and a database to host the images.

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

Selfie POTY will be a full stack application that host users and their images into a database. The users will be able to upload one image per category. Once they photo is uploaded it will be displayed into a gallery show the most recent uploads. Each image uploaded will have metadata associated with it which can be displayed in the recent upload gallery. There will also be a like button for users to use on other images uploaded by other users.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

I will use React, Express and MySql.

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.

I would like to classify each images using this api. https://docs.imagga.com/?node#tags

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

I am going to build a SPA with two pages. The home page is where you can upload a photo and where the recent uploads will be displayed. The about page will have a brief description about the contest and its categories.

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.
